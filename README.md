<strong> </strong>Find some data for experiments. You can use all films with titles, directors, actors and other related information. Some other data such as ‘Infected cases by COVID-19’, ‘Stock data’, ‘Library data’ etc. is also fine. But the size should be reasonably large.

Store the data into a database table. Then use select in SQL to find the films with word “XXX” in titles, and record the execution time.

Store the data into a file, and then load it into RAM. The data in RAM can be any format you preferred. Design an algorithm to search “XXX” in titles. Record the execution time of your algorithm.

Some other comparisons and experiments you would like to do. Such as you can reorganize data into some other format for faster retrieval. You are recommended to study the mechanism of DMBS for storing and retrieval

<h1>SUGGESTED structure of your report</h1>

<ol>

 <li><strong>Title </strong></li>

</ol>

Please give your report a title that can reflect the core point of your work.

<ol start="2">

 <li><strong>Introduction </strong></li>

</ol>

To introduce what you want to prove in the experiments. DO NOT copy any text from Internet.

<h2>3. Experimental design</h2>

<strong>3.1 Experimental data and environments.                                                                                   </strong>

Introduce the data, DBMS and the programming language you choose. How you organize the data.

<h3>3.2 Experiments</h3>

Describe your experiments here. To make sure the experiments should be reasonable and the comparisons should be fare.

<strong>3.3 Experimental results                                                                                                                  </strong>

Show your results in tables and figures, and analysis the differences of different methods.

<h2>4. Conclusions</h2>

Give your conclusions here. You can also present you options on DBMS.

Several website can give you some ideas to research, but those are only theory description:
